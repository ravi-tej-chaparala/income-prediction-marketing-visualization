- **Objective**: Increase UVW College's enrollment by tailoring marketing to demographics most likely to benefit from advanced education.

### Assumptions
- The dataset accurately represents the population relevant to UVW College.
- The $50,000 income threshold significantly influences educational needs and enrollment decisions.
- Demographic factors like age, education, marital status, and occupation are stable predictors of income.

### User Stories
1. **Educational Influence on Income**: Understand the impact of educational attainment on income levels to better market higher education benefits.
2. **Racial Income Distribution**: Identify income distribution across races for inclusive marketing.
3. **Age, Education, and Income Correlation**: Examine how age and education correlate with income to craft targeted messages for career advancement.
4. **Occupational Impact on Earnings**: Assess the combined effect of occupation and education on income for sector-specific campaigns.
